## Font size

The minimum recommended font size for form inputs is 16px.

Note: below a 16px font size iOS will automatically zoom in on the form input when focused, to make the text eadable.

## Invalid state

The invalid state should not only be indicated by color. Consider changing the appearance in another way, for xample by emphasising the border thickness.

## Disabled state

Consider maintaining the contrast at an accessible level, with a higher contrast than WCAG 2.1 requires.

## Placeholder text

Consider keeping text color contrast at an accessible level.

Consider a distinctive style for disabled text versus placeholder text.
